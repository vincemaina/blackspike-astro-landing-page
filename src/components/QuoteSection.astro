      <strong>Hi, I’m Vince</strong> — founder, developer, and your main point of contact here at
      AppSites. Since 2022 I’ve been building custom web and mobile apps for
      <strong>small businesses</strong>, <strong>startups</strong>, and <strong>solo founders</strong>. I started AppSites because
      I love building things that work, and because I saw how bloated and
      impersonal traditional agencies can be.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike big agencies, there’s no middle layer here. When you get in touch,
      you’re talking to the person who’s actually building your app. That means
      faster communication, fewer misunderstandings, and a smoother, more
      personal experience from start to finish.
    </p>

    <p>
      I mostly work with small to medium-sized businesses — people who have a
      great idea, or a simple tool in mind that will improve their customer
      experience, boost conversions, or just make life a bit easier. Maybe it’s
      a booking system. A customer portal. A cleaner way to manage repeat
      orders. Whatever it is, you don’t need a six-figure agency to make it
      happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Appsites, you’ll never be left in the dark. You’ll never be upsold
      something you don’t need. And you’ll always know exactly what you're
      paying for.
    </p>

    <p>Let’s build something great, together.</p>
