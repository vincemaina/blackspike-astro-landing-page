  {
    "question": "Is this just one guy? Can he really handle my whole app?",
    "answer": "Yep—just one, and that’s the point. You’re not dealing with layers of middlemen or a junior dev behind the scenes. You’re working directly with the person building your app, start to finish. That means better communication, faster turnaround, and nothing lost in translation.",
    "cta": "Let's talk about your idea"
  },
  {
    "question": "What if I need something more complex—like payments, logins, integrations?",
    "answer": "No problem. I’ve built apps with user accounts, payment systems, third-party integrations, and more. And if your project needs something super specialised, I’ve got a trusted network of developers and specialists I can call on."
  },
  {
    "question": "What if I'm not technical at all?",
    "answer": "Totally fine. Most of my clients aren’t. I’ll guide you through the whole process in plain English, help shape your idea, and keep you in the loop without drowning you in jargon.",
    "cta": "Book a no-pressure intro call"
  },
  {
    "question": "Will I be locked in or stuck relying on you forever?",
    "answer": "Not at all. Once your app is finished, you own everything—the code, the project files, the deployment details. You can run it independently, hand it off to your in-house team, or keep working with me for ongoing support. Your choice."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why wouldn't I just use a bigger agency?",
    "answer": "You could—but you'd likely pay more, wait longer, and spend more time explaining your vision to people who aren't building the app themselves. At AppSites, you get a high-quality product, built with the same tech as the big guys, but with less friction and a more personal touch."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much is this going to cost me?",
    "answer": "Every project is different, but one thing stays the same: transparent, fixed pricing. No hourly rates. No hidden fees. You’ll get a clear quote at the start, and as long as we stay within the agreed scope, that price won’t change."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I test the app before it's finished?",
    "answer": "Yes! You’ll get to see working versions of your app throughout development—not just a final reveal at the end. That way, you can give feedback early and often, and there are no nasty surprises."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will it work on all devices?",
    "answer": "Definitely. Whether we’re building a web app, mobile app, or desktop app, it will be tested on all relevant screen sizes and devices. You’ll get a product that looks great and works smoothly everywhere it needs to."
  },
  {
    "question": "How secure will my app be?",
    "answer": "Security is baked in from the start. We follow modern best practices for secure coding, data handling, and authentication. If your app has sensitive data or specific security needs, we’ll cover that in the planning phase."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do payments work?",
    "answer": "It’s 50% upfront, 50% on completion. That way, you know I’m committed—and you stay in control. No extra fees unless the scope changes, and if it does, you’ll get a clear, revised quote before anything moves forward."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens if I change my mind halfway through?",
    "answer": "Small tweaks are expected and welcomed—that’s why we keep you involved throughout. If there’s a bigger change that shifts the scope significantly, we’ll pause, chat, and agree on a revised plan and quote before continuing."
